                        <h3>DIY Subwoofer May 2011</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p> Its been a long time coming but this project is nearly at a close. Through all the deliberations and many possible ways I could have gone about completing this project I got through it mainly with improvisation and what was available to me. The outcome I wanted from this was to have a subwoofer which was very loud but also worked well with both movies and music as well as be able to fit into my small bedroom. Also being the miser I am, I wanted to do it on the smallest budget possible. So without further ado here are some pictures throughout the various stages of the build.</p>
                    <p> Box closed:</p>

                    <p> Huge magnet on this thing!</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (3).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Surround sound speakers to the right, subwoofer amp to the left:</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (39).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Temporary setup for testing etc</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (47).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> At this point I had really bad quality wires from the input to the potentiometer then to the circuit, but i later removed all of it and had copper wires going directly from the input to the circuit controlling the gain from the AV unit</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (37).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> So I dont forget the order for the power cable wires</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (41).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Some bad wiring and soldering</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (43).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> The capacitors and toroidal are all huge!</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (50).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> How it came</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (49).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Input sensitivity</p>

                    <p> This amp can be used for both HiFi and PA systems, the line level of a PA system is designed to travel over long distances therefore the input sensitivity is around 775mV, whereas HiFi and home audio the cables only have to travel a short distance and is therefore lower at 500mV. On the MF1000 Amp module there is a resistor that can be changed to change the sensitivity between 750 and 500mV. The resistor which came with the amp module was 390ohms meaning the sensitivity was 750mV, I could have just left it with this setup and just increased the gain through the AV receiver being sent to the sub but I decided to change it. Instead of taking the whole board off its mounting just to change one resistor I simply tacked a second resistor in parallel with the other which is pictured below. I added a 470ohm resistor to it making the total resistance around 213ohms. It still wasn't easy though as I had to fit a soldering iron, solder, and a resistor in a  tiny hole without melting any of the surrounding capacitors or touching the heatsinks.</p>

                    <p> Box Design  I wanted to use this sub 50/50 HT/Music so I wanted it to be able to hit the lower frequencies used in films just as well as it would the higher frequencies. I decided to build the box at a tune of ~20hz with a volume of 2.5 cu ft.</p>

                    <p> Cheers for the help dad!</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (17).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Just testing it while waiting for the speaker terminal to come!</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (15).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Adding the speaker terminal and putting the Amp in a box  I thought it would be safer to have the amp in an enclosure rather than exposed circuitry considering the power it is capable of.</p>
                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (44).jpg" alt="" /></a>
                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (19).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> The plan was to use to just use piece of coaxial between the plug and the input, but the outer shielding wouldn't take the solder so I just used the copper core from 2 coaxial cables instead</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (7).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> I improvised using some cable tie and cut up bits of coaxial outer layer to stop it from pulling out</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (26).jpg" alt="" /></a>
                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (27).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Because the sub amp had a very loud fan I wanted it out of the room for while I'm watching movies, so in order to achieve this I used a 10m coaxial cable, a knife, some solder and old phono connectors.</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (29).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> Phono plugs before and after</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (32).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> It only took 3 attempts</p>

                    <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/subwoofer/subwoofer (31).jpg" alt="" /></a>

                    <p> End result</p>
