                        <h3>London Oxford London 200k Audax - 13th March 2016</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>Getting out the door in Ware at 5am in the darkness my other senses seemed heightened. Able to feel forecast predictions were correct for this time of day, around 0 o C I set off confidently, knowing I had extra layers tucked in my trusty Carradice between food stashes – I had chosen ASDA flapjack and granola bars for the day. From the suburban yellow streetlights that had penetrated the morning dew I could see a layer of white frost had formed over my gloves, the biting chill causing me to cycle a much higher pace than planned on my cycle to the start of the Audax in Ruislip. Rendezvousing with Matthew Robinson en route via Hatfield  - he felt the need of an even higher pace than I had set out on to overcome the deep chill.</p>
                    <p>Arriving at the planned time of 7.20am we got the ticket number for our pre booked cooked breakfast and checked in to get our brevet card whilst the food was prepared. Mopping up the last of the bean sauce with the provided toast (great food and service, 6.5/10) we were outside and on our bikes as close to the start time as possible to avoid the chill. At 8am we were off and for the first 10 miles there were the indecisions that seem to happen on all Audax between myself and Matt on whether to stay with the group we’re in or drop off and find our own pace. Eventually a large group sped off leaving me, Matt and another cyclist named John whom had completed the Horsepower 200km Audax the day before. Initially planning to go straight on after getting our card stamped at the first control, by the time 60km had passed the bacon baps the Chinnor control had on offer were too good to miss, so, after a bap with lots of brown sauce (good quality bacon 7/10) we were on the road again. Though still a light mist the scenery was lovely with the sun working hard to get through. Similar to the sun Matt also worked hard to get through, taking to the front of our trio heading through the flat countryside towards Oxford into a headwind, although drafting behind him I was getting out of breath which you don’t want to be doing for too long on an all day ride but I was feeling good so persevered.</p>
                    <p>Rolling into Oxford we threaded seamlessly through the bustle of the city’s high street, the bright sunlight reflecting the grand limestone buildings permeating the many layers of cycling kit mixing with the warm feeling of reaching the half way point. Agreeing just a quick meal was wanted, upon getting our brevet cards stamped we continued straight on until spotting a fish and chip shop. Stopping not long after the control at the Mediterranean Fish Bar, fish and chips were ordered all round and whilst waiting for the order I attempted to barter offering to solve a Rubik's cube sitting next to the till in exchange for a discount and, though lots of praise was given, the meals were bought at retail price (friendly service but long wait for food to be cooked 6/10). Easing off at a very agreeable pace stomachs level with our ambition we were at the next control in Didcot before any sort of cycling formation could develop. The receipt of a quick dessert for control proof eaten in the afternoon sun we were off again wearing the least amount of layers needed all day. Not looking at the elevation data beforehand, it was time to pass back through the Chilterns. In stark contrast to the route towards Oxford where, if you looked hard enough, you would think the countryside fields and sky above them went on forever in parallel what could be seen ahead of us was nothing but land with a small bit of bright sky on top resembling a pint of Guinness, only a lot less palatable with this many miles in the legs (Crowmarsh to Cookley Green). Mind resembling the dark body of the pint, lactate the bitter taste; reaching the top matched the creamy head in both brightness and feeling. Agreeing how the view of the rolling countryside would be even better than it already is if there wasn’t the slight mist, we progressed on using the accrued potential energy on the potholed descent as a short break in pedalling. Minds still recovering, legs that never will; we cycled past the next control having to double back. Seeking comfort food in a warm pasty hoping a bottle of Lucazade would fill everything that seemed empty a lot more time was spent at this control than needed. Eventually rolling again we never did ease back up to normal pace for the rest of the ride.</p>
                    <p>Too early to be getting dark the light was fading but not from sunset another dark mass was approaching. Leaving most of what I had left on the hill before, I knew this would be a challenge. Attempting to hit the hill (Chinnor Hill) with some momentum I was already in my easiest gear before it started kicking up. Withdrawing from the world there was nothing but myself the, pedals and a few feet of road. This is why I like cycling. When faced with an impossible task everything else failing (mainly my legs!) I can use my mind to overcome the situation. There is a memory during this climb in a brief lapse of concentration on my own challenge where I looked up the hill and could see Jon leaning over the bike clearly trying to put power into the pedals but completely stationary somehow just balancing there. Returning to the challenge shutting off all but the parts of my mind controlling my legs, I breached the top averaging 50 cadence and 5.1mph. On the home straight now with just 2 more info controls before the finish. Enthusiastically agreeing on the suggestion to stop and turn our lights on in the hope I would somehow feel better afterwards, the trio of myself, Matt and Jon rode into the evening. With the light also went the noise of civilisation, cycling though a peaceful closed off lane amongst trees of Burnham beeches. The transition was gradual but obvious from the rural country lanes into the urban streets of London. It seemed as though we were returning to the start in both time and space in the way the streets got busier the further into Sunday evening we were getting, returning to the start, where it all began.</p>
                    <p>Getting to the finish control at 8.15am we bid our goodbyes to Jon and after a pleasant chat with organiser Tim Sollesse headed back to Ware, a quick stop in MC Donlads in between arriving at my home at 11.50pm.</p>

                        <h3>DunRun 2016 out and back by Sam Lipscombe July 2016</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>Matthew Robinson meeting me in Ware before setting off facilitated my procrastination by allowing me to make us one final pourover coffee. Over this brew he convinced me to completely change up my bike luggage setup quite confident I wouldn’t need my full winter kit through the night. He was right it was lovely weather on the road for 18 hours – Shorts and a jersey throughout! Gulping the last of our refined tasting coffee our thoughts swallowed into the mindfulness only cycling long distances through the night could achieve.</p>
                    <p>My safety blanket (jacket) jiggling, precariously cable tied to my handlebars we were off at 8.30pm in no sort of rush knowing we in fact had all night to get going. Joining the route in Epping worked out well. Although missing the atmosphere at the start the smog of anticipation and excitement which can only be absorbed with traffic and pollution were still forged in our memories from our past 2 Dunwich exploits. Merging seamlessly like worker ants on their way to some dropped rock confectionary we proceeded into the night.</p>
                    <p>A tailwind all the way, legs feeling great we were at Dunwich by 4:20am (110 miles from Ware). The journey was great, if people didn’t have brilliant lights they were on a crazy bike and sometimes it was both! Lifeless as the shingles, the coast was aflood with tired cyclists and their bikes. A sausage roll in hand we were able to watch the sun rise over the channel before stiffly mounting our bikes for the return journey.</p>
                    <p>The ride back was brilliant in the beginning. Getting to see so many more cyclists riding their contraptions, enduring eyes on tired faces, the inferno of motivation fuelled by camaraderie and nearing the finish. The cyclists soon thinned out leaving in their wake a headwind that would stay with us for the rest of the journey.</p>
                    <p>Stocking up on headwind mashing greasy calories in Little Chef I was fresh eyed (after picking the bugs out!) and excited to go into the new dawn. Matt at this point felt the exact opposite and now wanted the ride to be finished. Attempting to tow him along whilst he recovered I just got too excited and sped off the moment I sensed an up or down hill, this fashion continued throughout the morning until we eventually settled on a sustainable rhythm. Energy transferring all around, sun to body heat taken away by headwind, pedals turning throughout. Long thoughts to produce short sentences dropped from not making sense. Stopping longer on each break we eventually get to the longest break of all. A great ride, enjoyed every (210) mile of it.</p>

                        <h3>In 2014 I was hit head on by a van while cycling. I have no recollection of writing this but years later found it on my old laptop in a text file</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>The following are two stories concerning the same event that occurred on 29th of april 2014. The former is told as first perceived immediately following the incident, whereas the latter is constructed from disorganised fragmented memories strewn together over the days following the event. </p>
                    <p>Intro:</p>
                    <p>Monotonous days blend into weeks blend into months. Wake up, do project work, squeeze in time to eat, proceed until eyesight equals mind in a fatigued haze then sleep. Rinse and repeat. Deadline comes. Work handed in. Time passion and effort must find different avenues through which to be diffused, cycling amongst preparation for exams, and other things hazed out by cycling’s appeal gets bumped up to the front.</p>
                    <p>1 (between the head trauma and strong painkillers this is as best I remember it):</p>
                    <p>I half wake up after a good night’s sleep. But not fully awake, just aware that I am conscious and that senses are communicating with my brain.  There is a person in front of me taking the outline of a greenish blue oval with a brownish ball for a head. This person phases in and out of focus, and in the brief moment of focus I notice that the person is a doctor with a mask focusing intensely on my face. In this short time I see him I also notice his mask bobbing up and down which is when I become aware of the sense known as sound and as though it was there all along I start perceiving what the doctor is saying, something along the lines of “the injections in your face before anesthetised it and I am now sewing your face so that your skin can heal in the correct position”… (im not sure of what he actually said but this is how I perceived it at the time) “I know it’s painful but I have to finish and there is just a small amount of more stitches needed” following each short bit of pressure on my face comes sharp and intense pain, in my mind I remember saying to the doctor that it is extremely painful in areas away from the initial injections. In hindsight I was merely tensing my muscles and making wavy tight sounds with my mouth in sync with the pain.</p>
                    <p>I wake up, see my parents, what are they doing here? I don’t remember going to visit them (take in my peripheral vision) oh I’m not at theirs, continue scanning the room to see a nurse standing next to me smiling, she sees I acknowledge her and proceeds to talk (again im sure she structured this more elegantly and positively but this is how I perceived it in my fatigued semi-conscious state.) “You were in a bike crash. Your at hospital. You are now okay. How was the helicopter ride?”  (I later found out I was air lifted by helicopter to hospital). After hearing this is suddenly become conscious of just how comfortable whatever I’m lying on is and suddenly, overwhelmingly feel obliged to follow my intuition and drift back off to sleep.</p>
